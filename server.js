//Why i created this API

//  I created this API because three weeks ago, I had an interview that
//  consisted of two rounds. I did very well and was confident that I would be
//  selected, but I didn't get the job. I had no issue with not being selected,
//  but my issue was with the lack of communication.
//  They didn't even update me to say I didn't do well in the interview or that I wasn't a good fit for the role.
//  Something, anything, would have been appreciated.
//  This isn't the first time I've faced this issue,
//  so I created this API to send weekly emails until I get a reply or get blocked.
//  It's just for fun though ðŸ˜‚.
