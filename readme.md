# Interview Follow-Up API

I created this API because, three weeks ago, I had an interview consisting of two rounds. I felt confident about my performance and believed I would be selected. However, I didn't get the job.

### What bothered me?

I had no issue with not being selected, but my frustration came from the lack of communication. The company didn't update me, nor did they inform me that I didn't do well in the interview or that I wasn't a good fit for the role. Any kind of feedback or update would have been appreciated.

This isn't the first time I've faced this situation, and it inspired me to create this API.

### What does it do?

This API sends weekly emails to the employer until I get a reply or until I get blocked. It's a fun way to deal with the frustration of not hearing back after an interview.

### Just for Fun ðŸ˜‚

While the API serves as a humorous way to handle the situation, it also highlights the importance of feedback and communication in the hiring process.

As of today, November 29, 2024, I am currently using the API every two weeks. I actually got a reply from the company this time! ðŸ¤ž Hope they'll select me for the role!
